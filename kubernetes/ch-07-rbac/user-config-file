# We have a user jack created in kubernetes who is given very restricted permissions on cluster in namespace "test"
# Jack will use his workstation to access / manage kubernetes cluster
# Jack need to install "kubectl" on his machine - snap install kubectl --classic
# Jack need to create a directory ".kube" inside his home directory
# Admin will send copy of /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf to jack with these modifications (jack can also do these things by himself)
# Admin need to send jack.crt back to jack
